# Example: Angular with Angular Material and Flex-Layout

This is just a very basic layout that sizes to different viewports by splitting the flex-items appropriately. It pulls images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).

## Running

```
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:hlesesne/example-flex-layout.git
cd example-flex-layout
npm install
ng serve --ssl
```
